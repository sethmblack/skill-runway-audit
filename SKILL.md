# Runway Audit

Assess existing advantages and gaps, then either leverage advantages fully or build what's missing—for yourself and those who follow.

---

## When to Use

- Starting something new without obvious advantages
- Feeling disadvantaged compared to others who have succeeded
- Needing to identify what resources to develop
- User says "I don't have the advantages others have" or "How do I start from nothing?"
- Someone is dwelling on unfairness rather than taking action

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| goal | Yes | What the person is trying to achieve |
| perceived_disadvantages | Yes | What they feel they lack compared to others |
| comparison_points | No | Who they're comparing themselves to |
| available_resources | No | What they currently have access to |

## Earhart's Runway Philosophy

Amelia Earhart used the runway metaphor to reframe disadvantage as responsibility. A runway is what you need to take off. Some people have them built; others must build their own.

### The Core Insight
"Some of us have great runways already built for us. If you have one, take off. But if you don't have one, realize it is your responsibility to grab a shovel and build one for yourself and for those who will follow after you."

### The Two Responses
1. **If you have a runway:** Use it. Taking off is not optional when conditions are favorable.
2. **If you don't have a runway:** Build it. Complaining that others have runways changes nothing.

### The Legacy Dimension
Notice Earhart doesn't say "build one for yourself." She says "for yourself and for those who will follow after you." Every runway built is infrastructure for the future.

### Against Victimhood
The runway frame transforms "I don't have advantages" (passive, victimized) into "I must build advantages" (active, empowered). The unfairness is real; the response is what matters.

## The Audit Framework

### Step 1: Inventory Existing Runways
Runways you might not recognize:
- **Education runway:** Degrees, training, certifications
- **Experience runway:** Past roles, projects, achievements
- **Network runway:** Who you know, who knows you
- **Financial runway:** Savings, income stability, family support
- **Skills runway:** Capabilities others would pay for
- **Platform runway:** Audience, reputation, credibility
- **Location runway:** Access to markets, opportunities, talent
- **Time runway:** Flexibility, bandwidth, freedom

People often have more runway than they recognize.

### Step 2: Identify Missing Runways
Compare to what success requires:
- What runways do successful people in this space have?
- Which of those are truly necessary vs. nice-to-have?
- Which are buildable vs. gatekept?
- What's the minimum viable runway for takeoff?

### Step 3: Assess Using Existing Runways
If you have runways, are you using them?
- Are you fully leveraging your education?
- Are you activating your network?
- Are you deploying your skills at market rate?
- Are you using your platform for the goal?

Often the first problem isn't missing runways—it's unused runways.

### Step 4: Design the Construction Plan
For missing runways, what's the build plan?
- What's the fastest path to minimum viable runway?
- What can you build while working toward the goal?
- What shortcuts exist (borrowed runways, partnerships)?
- What must be built from scratch?

### Step 5: Build for Others
As you build:
- How can you make your runway available to others?
- What can you document for those who follow?
- What organizations or systems could extend your runway?
- How do you become the runway for someone else?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I want to start a podcast about entrepreneurship, but I don't have any connections in the industry. I'm not a successful entrepreneur myself. Other podcasters have built-in audiences and famous guests. I'm starting from zero."

**Output:**

## Runway Audit

### Goal
Launch an entrepreneurship podcast that attracts listeners and meaningful guests.

### Existing Runway Inventory
| Runway Type | What You Have | Currently Using? |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Education | Likely some relevant knowledge (you're interested enough to podcast about it) | Partially—knowledge exists, not deployed |
| Experience | Your own entrepreneurial attempts, jobs, observations | No—you're discounting this as "not successful enough" |
| Network | Current contacts, acquaintances, social connections | No—"no connections" is rarely literally true |
| Financial | Unknown—can you afford basic equipment and time? | Unknown |
| Skills | Ability to learn, communicate, prepare | Unknown |
| Platform | Social media presence, any existing audience | Likely no—but this is what the podcast builds |
| Location | Access to internet, potential for in-person interviews | Likely yes |
| Time | Availability to record, edit, publish | Unknown |

### Unused Runway Alert
You have runways you're discounting:

**Experience runway:** "Not a successful entrepreneur" is not the only relevant experience. You have observations, lessons from failures, research capability, curiosity. The best interviewers are not always the most accomplished—often they're the most curious.

**Network runway:** "No connections" likely means "no famous connections." But you know people who know people. You have weak ties that could become strong ties. You probably know at least one entrepreneur personally.

**Knowledge runway:** You care enough about this topic to start a podcast. That's genuine interest that can be converted into preparation depth that guests notice.

### Missing Runways
**Platform runway:** Yes, you're starting without an audience. This is real but common—every podcaster started here.

**Guest access runway:** Yes, you don't have easy access to famous guests. But famous guests are not required to start.

### Construction Plan
| Missing Runway | Build Strategy | Timeline |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Platform | Start publishing consistently; audience builds from zero over time | Ongoing, 6-12 months for meaningful growth |
| Guest access (tier 1) | Interview entrepreneurs in your existing network first | Immediately |
| Guest access (tier 2) | Use first guests as referrals to their contacts | Months 2-4 |
| Guest access (tier 3) | Leverage growing catalog as proof of quality | Months 4-8 |
| Guest access (tier 4) | Famous guests come when you've proven you're worth their time | Months 8+ |

**The Borrowed Runway Strategy:** You don't need your own platform to start—you need good episodes. Make your early episodes so good that guests share them. Your guests' platforms become your borrowed runway.

### Building for Others
As you build this runway:
- Document your process publicly for others starting podcasts
- When you gain guest access, introduce other quality podcasters to your network
- Create templates and resources for those starting from similar positions
- Remember that your early episodes become the proof that "starting from zero" works

### The Earhart Verdict
You're comparing your beginning to others' middles. Yes, established podcasters have advantages you lack. But they built those advantages—they weren't born with audiences and Rolodexes.

The question is not "Do I have a runway?" but "Am I building one?"

Stop dwelling on what you don't have. Grab a shovel. Interview your first entrepreneur friend this week. Then the next. Your hundredth episode will have guests your first episode couldn't dream of—because you'll have a runway by then.

"Some of us have great runways already built for us. If you have one, take off. But if you don't have one, realize it is your responsibility to grab a shovel and build one for yourself and for those who will follow after you."

The shovel is in your hands. Start building.
